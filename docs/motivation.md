## The Structurizr Mini Workflow

Here's the workflow that I built Structurizr Mini to fit into.


- `workspace.dsl` is committed to version control
- Use Structurizr Lite to view diagrams while iterating on `workspace.dsl` locally
- `workspace.json` generated by Structurizr Lite is not committed
- Diagrams are all `autoLayout`
  - Occasionally I comment out `autoLayout` and manually tweak a diagram I want to export for a specific purpose.
- CI generates a `workspace.json` from the committed `workspace.dsl`, and publishes a Structurizr Mini site to S3
